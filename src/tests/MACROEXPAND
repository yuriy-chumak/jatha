;;;; MACRO tests

; defmacro calls declared function and stores result as code
; for test defmacro can be wrote defun and executes
; for example:

(defun f (x) (list '+ x x))
;(f 12) must be equal to (LIST + 12 12) and after execute (eval (f 12)) must be 24
(= (eval (f 12)) 24)

; (&rest x) stores all arguments in list
; (defun f (&rest x) x)
; (f 1 2 3) produces list (1 2 3)
